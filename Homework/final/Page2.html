  <p>In high school, I completed a number of different photography projects, but most of them got erased at the end of the semester after a computer malfunctioned in the studio.
  (This was before I learned the wonders of external hard drives, but you live and you learn). Below are some examples of my photography.</p>

  <p>To the left is perhaps my favorite photo I've ever taken, titled "Division." I've used this photo as my desktop since I first took it in my junior year of high school.<br><br>What really draws me to this photo not only how I captured the wave crashing over a rock in the perfect manner, but that it almost divides the frame exactly in half.
     (Which inspired the name).<br><br>Beyond being an interesting photo to look at, the fact that it has been my desktop for so long makes it a good conversation starter. Some of my closest photography friends have come up to me saying they liked that photo, leading me to make some genuine connections.
