  <p>Music is something I've always dreamed of creating since I first began developing my own musical taste throughout high school. I have always been drawn to replicating drum patterns of my favorite songs, so it was only a matter of time until I got my hands on FL Studio and decided to jump in. Check out some of my work below.</p>

  <p>Over this past summer, I finally began to pursue something I had dreamed about since I first picked up GarageBand in middle school: producing my own music. While I had created some admittedly terrible music before, I decided to dive into FL Studio and actually create something I was proud of.<br><br>After months of trials and tribulations, I finally got past the mental block of releasing my music to the public, and posted my first "EP" COLORS to my soundcloud on October 4th of this year. COLORS is composed of my first two official songs INSIDE and OUTSIDE, both having to do with my feelings towards the outside world and my introverted past. <br><br> Beyond just pursuing an additional hobby, music has allowed me to realize more about myself than any other avenue of art I've pursued so far. Music has always had a large impact on my life, from listening to anything I could come accross or messing around on my guitar and drumset. Creating my own tracks has given me an insight into how I can make others feel certain emotions through the tone and tempo of my instrumentals.

  <p>After dropping COLORS on my Soundcloud this fall, I immediately got to work on another project. Though I can't reveal too much about this project quite yet (as it is still in progress), it is far better and different than my previous material.<br><br>As of now, the working title for this project is "ArcadeNights." The project's sound is far more adventurous than COLORS, showcasing my growing skills and inventiveness as a producer.<br><br>While I wait to finish some final mixing of ArcadeNights, I am working on my best material yet. This will follow the release of ArcadeNights.<br><br><a href="https://soundcloud.com/the-kid-slym">Click Here to View My Soundcloud</a></p>
