  <p>Over this past summer, I finally began to pursue something I had dreamed about since I first picked up GarageBand in middle school: producing my own music. While I had created some admittedly terrible music before, I decided to dive into FL Studio and actually create something I was proud of.<br><br>After months of trials and tribulations, I finally got past the mental block of releasing my music to the public, and posted my first "EP" COLORS to my soundcloud on October 4th of this year. COLORS is composed of my first two official songs INSIDE and OUTSIDE, both having to do with my feelings towards the outside world and my introverted past. <br><br> Beyond just pursuing an additional hobby, music has allowed me to realize more about myself than any other avenue of art I've pursued so far. Music has always had a large impact on my life, from listening to anything I could come accross or messing around on my guitar and drumset. Creating my own tracks has given me an insight into how I can make others feel certain emotions through the tone and tempo of my instrumentals.
