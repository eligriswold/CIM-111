    <p>My name is Eli Griswold, and I am a junior Motion Pictures major at the University of Miami. I began my college education at Boston University in 2017 before transferring to Miami in the fall of 2018.
      Throughout college, I have studied a variety of different fields, including print and broadcast journalism, film production and writing, as well as sports administration.<br><br>
      However, while I am a film major, my interests range far beyond that. I have always been a well-rounded person, and have enjoyed creating different forms of content my whole life.
      Aside from writing and film, I used to make music with my friends in middle school, and recently revisited this hobby this past year, developing my music production skills.
      I have also always enjoyed taking photos, particularly of nature and run-down buildings.</p>
  </section>
  <p>This website is meant to display the various content I've created so far, and I either took or created every picture on this site. Enjoy!</p>

  <h1>Talents and Interests</h1>
  <h1 id="centerName">Photography</h1>
  <p id="toggleGraph">While my interests have varied throughout my life, I have always been drawn to photography. In the past, I have experiemented with portraits, but I am mainly
  interested in landscape and nature photography. Click the "Photography" section at the top of the page to view some of my work!</p>
  <h1 id="centerName">Film</h1>
  <p id="toggleGraph">I was first introduced to filmmaking in high school as a part of my Digital Imaging class's curriculum. This initial exposure grew into a passion, and I quickly fell in love with all aspects of film.
  Click the "Film" section at the top of the page to learn more!</p>
  <h1 id="centerName">Music</h1>
  <p id="toggleGraph">Though I had always been fascinated by music production and listening to music, I never thought I could replicate the process myself. This changed over the summer, when I finally downloaded FL Studio and started to mess around. Click the "Music" section above to check out my debut EP!</p>
