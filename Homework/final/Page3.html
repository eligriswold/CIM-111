  <h2 id="centerName">Examples of My Work</h2>
  <p>As I mentioned before, I first got into film production in the middle of high school. I took Digital Imaging as an elective, not thinking I would enjoy the process of creation as much as I did. Check out some of my work aand experience below.</p>

  <p>Oops! It looks like this content could not be found. That's because there is none. As I mentioned in the photography section, some of my best work was lost in the studio back in high school. However, in the near future, I will be uploading music videos, short films, or other content.
    <br><br>While I don't have access to the film, my proudest achievement in filmmaking came when me and my friends decided to adapt the Greek myth of Thesius and the Minataur into a short, claymation/live action mix in Digital Imaging. Though the process was greuling and took almost the entire semester to create, we ended up winning first place at the Shoreline Arts Alliance's Future Choices competition (hosted by Lyme Academy in my hometown of Old Lyme, Connecticut).
    <br><br>One of my group members supposedly kept a version of this video, so I will hope to upload a link here as soon as possible. Stay tuned for some awesome content.
