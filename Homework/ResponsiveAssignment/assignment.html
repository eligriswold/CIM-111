          <p>My name is Eli Griswold, and I am a junior Motion Pictures major at the University of Miami. I began my college education at Boston University in 2017 before transferring to Miami in the fall of 2018.
            Throughout college, I have studied a variety of different fields, including print and broadcast journalism, film production and writing, as well as sports administration.<br><br>
            However, while I am a film major, my interests range far beyond that. I have always been a well-rounded person, and have enjoyed creating different forms of content my whole life.
            Aside from writing and film, I used to make *bad* music with my friends in middle school, and recently revisited this hobby this past year, developing my music production skills.
            I have also always enjoyed taking photos, particularly of nature and run-down buildings.</p>
        </section>
        <p>This website is meant to display the various content I've created so far, and I either took or created every picture (other than my profile photo) on this site. Enjoy!</p>

        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <p>As I mentioned above, I have always had a broad range of interests throughout my life. When I was younger, I threw together videos and songs with my friends, and beginning in high school, I started taking photos. Around the time I got into photography, I started taking filmmaking more seriously, watching thousands of movies to study how different directors developed their styles, and how films were written and adapted to the screen. When I got to Miami, I started broadcasting different Hurricanes sporting events, something I had always dreamed of doing since I first discovered my love for sports in around fifth grade.</p>

          <p>Over this past summer, I finally began to pursue something I had dreamed about since I first picked up GarageBand in middle school: producing my own music. While I had created some admittedly terrible music before, I decided to dive into FL Studio and actually create something I was proud of.<br><br>After months of trials and tribulations, I finally got past the mental block of releasing my music to the public, and posted my first "EP" COLORS to my soundcloud on October 4th of this year. COLORS is composed of my first two official songs INSIDE and OUTSIDE, both having to do with my feelings towards the outside world and my introverted past. <br><br> Beyond just pursuing an additional hobby, music has allowed me to realize more about myself than any other avenue of art I've pursued so far. Music has always had a large impact on my life, from listening to anything I could come accross or messing around on my guitar and drumset. Creating my own tracks has given me an insight into how I can make others feel certain emotions through the tone and tempo of my instrumentals.
